/*
 Using automatically inheritance will inherit all non-spacial method from parent class but it won't take care of
 initialization of the derived class member
 Non-spacial members are
 1. constructor with agruments
 2. copy assisgments
 and other
 
 However, the DERIVED class constructors, destructors, and overloaded assignment operators can invoke the
 base-class versions
